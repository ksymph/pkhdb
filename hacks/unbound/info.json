  "description": "<h2>Story</h2><p>Welcome to Borrius, a region rich with history. Centuries ago, the Borrian people were enveloped in a great war with a foreign land. When all seemed lost, the Borrian king summoned a powerful force to help turn the tide of battle. Unfortunately, the war ended in defeat when the king of the foreign land unleashed a devastating weapon. Disgruntled, the Borrian army returned home. The people, now enraged against the Borrian king, attempted a coup by manipulating the dark force summoned during the war. The Borrian king was able to seal away its power, however, and the coup was thwarted. Many years later, an organization known simply as the \"Shadows\" seems bent on releasing the dark force once again. Are they after the destruction of the Borrius region, or is there something else at play? It's up to you to stand in their way!</p><h2>Features</h2><ul><li>A Powerful Engine: Pushing the Complete FireRed Upgrade to its maximum potential, Pokemon Unbound contains a custom battle engine on par with Gen 8, as well as many quality of life features that improve the gameplay experience just waiting to be found.
