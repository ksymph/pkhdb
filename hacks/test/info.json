	"description": "<p>This is a game about the adventure of a 16-year-old girl from the peaceful island of Crysta. She's on a journey to become a Pokémon Champion, aiming to secure one of the 8 spots in the finals set on the mysterious Elysium island. However, unbeknownst to her, an ancient dark presence, setting in motion a plan more than 100 years in the making, will endanger not only her and her friends but the entire world.</p><p>It is a story/lore-focused Fire Red hack for casual players, developed years ago (although content was added until very recently) that I decided to release it despite originally not planning to. It is a lengthy one, especially if you explore everything and follow the various side quests, and it is divided into two parts, A and B.</p><h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>A mix of Pokémon and types up until Pokémon X and Y. Gen I, II and III mostly but there's a decent number of Pokémon from the next generations like Hippopotas, Garchomp, Rhyperion or Galvantula</li><li>About 100 moves from Gen IV - Gen VI generation</li><li>Fairy Type-Pokémon & Moves (replacing old ones)</li><li>Physical-Special Split</li><li>Some standard QoL features like BW Repel System, Reusable TMs and HMs as out-of-battle items.</li><li>A simplistic Quest Log</li><li>A very few story-only related fakemon and fakemoves (permanent)</li><li>Mega Evolutions</li><li>Several Regions to explore.</li><li>Side quests that reward you with rare Pokémon, moves or special items.</li></ul>",
