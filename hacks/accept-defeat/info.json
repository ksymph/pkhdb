  "description": "<p>You've just survived a shipwreck. You need to get home to Fuchsia City by any means possible... but you're no trainer. You're just a fisherman, washed up on a strange island, with only a few items in your pack and a single Pokémon. You never needed to Fly, so you never got the Thunderbadge. And now you're trapped on an island crawling with scary-strong trainers, and you have to find your way home.</p><p>Accept Defeat is a puzzle-y, atmospheric experience that explores the mechanics of the Pokémon world. It's not particularly long (you could probably speedrun one ending in two minutes), but there are three distinct ways to play the game, leading to three endings, and one of them takes quite a bit of time and dedication.</p><h2>Features</h2><ul><li>An unlikely protagonist and a new archipelago to explore!</li><li>A single new Pokémon, with an interesting gimmick!</li><li>A completely unique battle mechanic that rewards creative teambuilding!</li><li>Many small puzzles to solve in battles; larger puzzles to solve in the world!</li><li>A brand new type of hidden item!</li><li>Running Shoes indoors and a Bicycle from the start!</li><li>Wait, three endings?! And one of the endings requires you to solve a difficult puzzle based on the core mechanics of the game?!</li></ul>",
