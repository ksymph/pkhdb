  "description": "<p>Worked on over the course of half a decade, Star Beasts is a Gen 1 dex overhaul and homage to the first generation of Pokémon games. Started as a passion project to make a playable version of Vast Fame's Shi Kong Xing Shou for English speaking audiences, Star Beasts became its own project with entirely new fakemon designs.</p><p>Some of the new features are as follows:</p><ul><li>A completely overhauled soundtrack! Almost none of the music from the original games remains!</li><li>An overhauled Pokedex, complete with backsprites, that fixes balance issues and replaces uglier designs and makes older evolutionary families more consistent.</li><li>Even more overhauled movesets, with even more new moves!</li><li>The Steel and Dark type!</li><li>New areas and new in-game events!</li><li>New types of trainers with different rosters and improved AI!</li><li>New dialogue, including getting rid of references to \"Pokemon.\" (Unless the team forgot, oops!)</li><li>Rebalancing of the game to make it more accessible to newcomers, including plenty of NPCs that give you hints on where to find rare Star Beasts!</li><li>And, as if that weren't enough, there's documentation on every Beast! (Although the game is best experienced blind, use your discretion!)</li><li>Various quality of life improvements, such as an experience bar!</li></ul>",
